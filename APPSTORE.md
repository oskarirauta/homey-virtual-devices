# Virtual Devices2

This app gives you the opportunity to add Virtual Devices to Homey. You can operate the Virtual Devices from the UI and/or use them in flows.

Or you can add a mode and add it as a condition, e.g. to disable multiple flows when going on Holiday.

This is fork of original Virtual Devices app with attempt to add ZoneID tag to flow cards to better identification of devices.
